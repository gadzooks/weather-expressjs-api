Add Slack notifications and deployment tracking to CI/CD pipeline

Implement comprehensive deployment monitoring with Slack integration:

- Add deployment summary notifications for all environments (dev, qa, prod)
- Generate production deployment diffs showing commits and file changes
- Add weekly reminder if production hasn't been deployed in 7+ days
- Create reusable composite actions for deployment tracking

New reusable actions:
- get-last-prod-deployment: Query GitHub Deployments API
- generate-prod-diff: Generate git diff with Slack/GitHub formatting
- post-deployment-summary: Post commit comments (visible in Slack)

Workflow modifications:
- ci.yml: Add deployment summary for dev deployments
- deploy-qa.yml: Add deployment summary for qa deployments
- deploy-prod.yml: Add diff generation, history fetch, and summary
- prod-deployment-reminder.yml: New weekly staleness check workflow

Documentation:
- docs/SLACK-SETUP.md: Complete Slack integration guide
- docs/CI-CD.md: Updated with Slack notifications section
- IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md: Implementation details and architecture
- TESTING-CHECKLIST.md: Comprehensive testing guide

All notifications use GitHub Slack app (no webhooks required).
No additional secrets needed - uses built-in GITHUB_TOKEN.

Fixes requirements 4-6 from CI/CD enhancement plan.
